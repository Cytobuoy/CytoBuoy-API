The CytoBuoy-API enables anyone to open CytoSense datafiles from a programmers enviroment. Currently we support C#, VB.net and Matlab. Basiscally, the API can do whatever CytoClus 4 can do and more.

The examples can be found in the Code_examples folder. Please study the instructions in the comments and step through the code using the debugger. We have provided some example datafiles in the Datafile_examples folder to play with.
